if you needed to keep track of how often you see the same word, 
even though you only want to count it once you could make a 
variable that keeps track of that frequency and put it in a list
such that the index of the frequency count is the same as the 
index in the ArrayList so you know which word the frequency 
corresponds too or better yet use a HashMap where the key is 
the distinct word and the value is its frequency basically 
use the same code as above but instead of ArrayList use HashMap 
and add in some variable to count the frequency
